    {/* I was educated at the Eurasian National University named after Gumilyov. I helped create a website for the university. Six months later, I became the team leader of the development team at the university. We created websites for small and medium-sized businesses. I was inspired by the story of Mark Zuckerberg, and my team also created a social network for the university, but unfortunately we could not find sponsors and a year later the project was closed. After university, I worked as a front-end developer using React. Every day I train my programming skills. I read books, solve algorithmic problems on the leetcode website, participated in training at the EPAM online school and reached the last grade 4. I create my own full stack applications and carry out freelance projects. */}
